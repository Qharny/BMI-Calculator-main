 # BMI Calculator in C++

This is a simple BMI calculator program written in C++. It allows the user to enter their weight and height, and then calculates their BMI. The program also provides instructions on how to use it.

## Prerequisites

To run this program, you will need a C++ compiler. You can download one from the [official website](https://www.cplusplus.com/download/).

## Usage

To use the program, simply clone the repository and run the `bmi_calculator.cpp` file. You will be prompted to enter your weight and height. The program will then calculate your BMI and display it on the screen.

## Code Explanation

The program is divided into three main parts:

1. The `calculateBMI()` function calculates the user's BMI.
2. The `instructions()` function displays instructions on how to use the program.
3. The `main()` function controls the flow of the program.

The `calculateBMI()` function takes two parameters: the user's weight and height. It then calculates the user's BMI using the following formula:

```
BMI = weight / (height * height)
```

The `instructions()` function simply displays instructions on how to use the program.

The `main()` function controls the flow of the program. It first displays a menu of options. The user can choose to calculate their BMI, view instructions, or quit the program. If the user chooses to calculate their BMI, the `calculateBMI()` function is called. If the user chooses to view instructions, the `instructions()` function is called. If the user chooses to quit the program, the program exits.

## Conclusion

This is a simple BMI calculator program written in C++. It is easy to use and understand, and it can be used to calculate your BMI quickly and easily.
